### Python source files for the paper: Grouped Sparse Projection.

Authors: Nicolas Gillis, Riyasat Ohib, Sergey Plis,Â Vamsi Potluru.

In this paper, we design a new sparse projection method for a set of vectors in order to achieve a desired average level of sparsity which is measured using the ratio of the l1 and l2 norms.

This work supersedes the work by
